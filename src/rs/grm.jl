    grm(gt)

Given the genotypes of `Matrix{Int8}`, this function calculate the genomic 
relationship matrix `GRM`. If the matrix is too big, the content will be 
calculated block by block and written to a file, else it will return a 
`Matrix{Float64}`.

By default the matrix needs to be 'nlc by nid' to speed up the calculation.
Such a matrix stores the genotypes continuously, which can speed up the 
matrix multiplication very much.  Another reason is that genotypes are
usually stored continuous for each individual.  They can can be read 
continuously in the `gt` columns.

If a `δ`, e.g., `δ = 0.01`, to the diagonals, you have to do this after this
function.
